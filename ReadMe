Trading bot example using a few hard-coded stocks

This bot uses the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stock price. 
Traders use the MACD to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high in order to identify entry and exit points for trades.

This bot uses Apache Trading Platform's API to submit trades and yahoo finance to check current stock statistics. 

Originally built just for fun, turned into a potential to make money, ran into latency issues when submitting trades.
